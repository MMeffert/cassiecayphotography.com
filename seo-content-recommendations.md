      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
          <h3>What areas do you serve for photography sessions?</h3>
          <p>I provide professional photography services throughout the Madison, Wisconsin area, including Waunakee, Middleton, Sun Prairie, Verona, and all of Dane County. I'm happy to travel to your preferred location or suggest beautiful outdoor spots perfect for your family session.</p>
          
          <h3>How far in advance should I book my photography session?</h3>
          <p>For the best availability, I recommend booking your Madison family photography session 4-6 weeks in advance. Newborn sessions should be scheduled during your second trimester, and senior portrait sessions are most popular in spring and fall.</p>
          
          <h3>What should we wear for our family photos?</h3>
          <p>I provide a detailed style guide with outfit suggestions for your Madison family photography session. Generally, coordinating colors work better than matching outfits, and I recommend avoiding busy patterns or logos.</p>
          
          <h3>Do you offer indoor photography sessions?</h3>
          <p>Yes! I offer both outdoor and indoor photography sessions in the Madison area. I have a home studio in Waunakee, or I can come to your home for lifestyle newborn and family sessions.</p>
