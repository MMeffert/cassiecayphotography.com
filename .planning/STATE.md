### Blockers/Concerns

From research - critical pitfalls to monitor:

- **Revolution Slider fragility**: Do NOT bundle Revolution Slider scripts or upgrade jQuery
- **Dreamweaver workflow**: Build step must enhance, not replace HTML editing
- **Image quality**: Use conservative settings on photography portfolio (JPEG 85+, AVIF 60+)
- **CloudFront cache**: 1-year cache on assets requires content hashing or invalidation
