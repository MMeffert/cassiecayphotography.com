## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Renamed file + updated HTML for broken link | Both file and reference needed correction |
| 01-01 | Removed first duplicate message element | Second element is active (has styling, used by JS) |
| 01-02 | Deleted old CloudFront before CDK domain setup | Free domain aliases for CDK-managed distribution |
| 01-02 | Used CDK-managed ACM with DNS validation | Automatic certificate renewal, infrastructure as code |
| 01-03 | Removed legacy bucket immediately after migration | Least-privilege IAM, no stale permissions |
| 02-01 | jQuery/Bootstrap/Popper external, not bundled | Preserves plugin compatibility and load order |
| 02-01 | Revolution Slider copied as-is without hashing | Complex internal asset references would break |
| 02-01 | ES module project (type: module) | Modern Vite configuration support |
| 02-01 | Browser targets: no IE11 | Modern browsers only (>0.5%, last 2 versions) |
| 02-02 | Custom Vite plugin for Revolution Slider CSS | transformIndexHtml to fix CSS link tags converted to module scripts |
| 03-01 | Conservative quality: AVIF 85, WebP 85, JPEG 90 | Photography portfolio requires high quality preservation |
| 03-01 | 4 responsive widths: full, 1800w, 1200w, 800w | Optimal serving for different contexts (lightbox vs thumbnails) |
| 03-01 | PNG transparency detection | Skip JPEG for alpha images, use AVIF/WebP |
| 03-02 | Deferred quality review | Proceed with HTML updates while review continues in parallel |

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

From research - critical pitfalls to monitor:

- **Revolution Slider fragility**: Do NOT bundle Revolution Slider scripts or upgrade jQuery - ADDRESSED in 02-01 (copied as-is)
- **Dreamweaver workflow**: Build step must enhance, not replace HTML editing
- **Image quality**: Use conservative settings on photography portfolio (JPEG 85+, AVIF 60+) - ADDRESSED in 03-01 (AVIF 85, WebP 85, JPEG 90)
- **CloudFront cache**: 1-year cache on assets requires content hashing or invalidation - ADDRESSED in 02-01 (content hashing enabled)
- **Quality review**: Deferred review in progress - may need settings adjustment if issues found
