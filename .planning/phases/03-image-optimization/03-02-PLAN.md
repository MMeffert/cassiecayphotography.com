<objective>
Human verification checkpoint for image quality before HTML migration

Purpose: Cassie (the photographer) must approve that the optimized images maintain professional portfolio quality. This checkpoint ensures no visible quality degradation before we update the site HTML to use the new images.

Output: Quality approval or feedback for adjustments

  <name>Task 1: Create quality comparison page</name>
  <files>quality-review.html</files>
  <action>
Create a standalone HTML page `quality-review.html` in the project root that displays side-by-side comparisons of original vs optimized images.

Include samples from each image category:
- 2 portrait/family images (skin tones, fine hair detail)
- 2 newborn images (soft lighting, delicate features)
- 1 engagement/couples image
- 1 full-size lightbox image comparison
- 1 thumbnail/crop comparison

For each sample, show:
1. Original image (from images/)
2. AVIF version (from images-optimized/avif/)
3. WebP version (from images-optimized/webp/)
4. JPEG version (from images-optimized/jpeg/)
5. File size comparison for each

The page should:
- Use simple HTML with inline styles (no build required)
- Be viewable by opening directly in browser
- Show images at actual display size AND with zoom capability
- Include file size badges on each image
- Have clear labels: "Original", "AVIF (85)", "WebP (85)", "JPEG (90)"

Add instructions at top for how to review:
1. Check skin tones for "watercolor effect" (smoothing)
2. Look for fine detail preservation (hair, texture)
3. Verify color accuracy
4. Zoom in on faces for quality comparison

Suggest specific images to include based on variety:
- cassiecay-F1-full.png (family portrait, PNG)
- cassiecay-NB18-crop.jpg (newborn, detailed)
- cassiecay-E1-full.png (engagement)
- cassiecay-senior3-full.png (senior portrait)
- cassiecay-aboutbw.jpg (black and white, tests contrast)
- cassiecay-slider7.jpg (hero image, most visible)
  </action>

File quality-review.html exists.
Opening in browser shows comparison grid.
All sample images load correctly.

  <name>Task 2: Photographer quality approval</name>
  <what-built>
Image optimization pipeline with CONSERVATIVE quality settings:
- AVIF quality 85 (vs typical 60-70)
- WebP quality 85 (vs typical 75-80)
- JPEG quality 90 (vs typical 80-85)

All 219 portfolio images have been converted to AVIF, WebP, and optimized JPEG formats.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open `quality-review.html` in your browser (just double-click the file)

2. For each sample image, compare:
   - SKIN TONES: Look for the "watercolor effect" where skin appears painted/smoothed
   - FINE DETAIL: Check hair strands, eyelashes, fabric texture
   - COLOR ACCURACY: Ensure colors match the original
   - CONTRAST: Especially important for the B&W image

3. Zoom in (right-click > Open Image in New Tab) to check detail at full size

4. Pay special attention to:
   - The newborn images (delicate features)
   - The hero slider image (most prominent on site)
   - Any image where you know the original quality intimately

5. Check the file size reduction - we want quality preserved even if sizes are larger than typical optimized images

**If quality is acceptable:**
Reply with "approved" or "quality approved"

**If quality issues found:**
Describe which images have issues and what you see (e.g., "cassiecay-F1-full.avif has noticeable smoothing on skin")
We can increase quality settings further if needed.

  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" to proceed with HTML updates, or describe quality issues found

<success_criteria>
1. Quality comparison page created and accessible
2. Cassie has reviewed representative sample images
3. Quality is explicitly approved before proceeding
4. No visible degradation on portrait skin tones
5. Fine detail preserved in hair and textures
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-image-optimization/03-02-SUMMARY.md`

Record:
- Quality verdict (approved/needs adjustment)
- Any specific feedback from Cassie
- Final quality settings confirmed
</output>
