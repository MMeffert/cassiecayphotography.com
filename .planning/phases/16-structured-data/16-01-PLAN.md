<objective>
Add JSON-LD structured data schemas to improve Google search visibility.

Purpose: Enable rich results in Google search (local business info, photographer profile, image gallery previews) which improves click-through rates and local search ranking.

Output: index.html with three JSON-LD schema blocks in the `<head>` section.

Add three JSON-LD script blocks inside the `<head>` section, immediately before the closing `</head>` tag (after the reCAPTCHA badge style, before line 114).

**Schema 1: LocalBusiness with nested Photographer**

**Schema 2: ImageGallery** (references 6 representative portfolio images)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ImageGallery",

      "name": "Milestone photography"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation notes:**
- Each schema goes in its own `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag
- Use absolute URLs (https://cassiecayphotography.com/...) for all URLs and images
- Leave telephone field empty string (business uses booking system, not direct calls)
- Do NOT nest schemas within each other - use `additionalType` for Photographer on LocalBusiness
- Validate JSON syntax before inserting (no trailing commas, proper quoting)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `npm run build` completes without errors
2. Open dist/index.html and verify JSON-LD blocks are present
3. Browser console shows no JSON parsing errors: `JSON.parse(document.querySelector('script[type="application/ld+json"]').textContent)`
  </verify>
  <done>
- index.html contains two JSON-LD script blocks
- LocalBusiness schema has geo coordinates (43.0731, -89.4012)
- Photographer type is included via additionalType
- ImageGallery references 6 portfolio images with absolute URLs
- No JSON syntax errors
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>JSON-LD structured data schemas for LocalBusiness, Photographer, and ImageGallery</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run local dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Copy the page URL or the deployed URL
3. Go to: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
4. Enter URL or paste HTML source
5. Verify results show:
   - LocalBusiness detected with geographic coordinates
   - No errors or warnings on required fields
   - ImageGallery detected (may show as "Image" or similar)

**Alternative validation:** https://validator.schema.org/
- Paste the JSON-LD blocks directly
- Should show LocalBusiness and ImageGallery types with no errors

**Browser console check:**
Open DevTools Console on the page and run:
```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('script[type="application/ld+json"]').forEach((s, i) => {
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(s.textContent);
    console.log(`Schema ${i+1}:`, data['@type']);
  } catch(e) {
    console.error(`Schema ${i+1} parse error:`, e);
  }
});
```
Should output "LocalBusiness" and "ImageGallery" with no errors.
