<objective>
Clean up Revolution Slider directory and perform human verification of the modernized libraries.

Purpose: Ensure the replacement libraries (GLightbox, Embla Carousel) provide professional visual quality matching the original implementation. Delete the now-unused Revolution Slider directory to reduce repository size.

Output: Verified working site with modern lightweight libraries, Revolution Slider files deleted, production-ready build.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Delete Revolution Slider directory</name>
  <files>style/revolution/ (DELETE)</files>
  <action>
1. Verify Revolution Slider is no longer referenced:
   ```bash
   grep -r "revolution" index.html
   grep -r "revolution" style/js/custom-scripts.js
   grep -r "revolution" vite.config.js
   ```
   All should return nothing or only comments.

2. Delete the Revolution Slider directory:
   ```bash
   rm -rf style/revolution/
   ```

3. Verify deletion:
   ```bash
   ls style/revolution/ 2>&1  # Should show "No such file or directory"
   ```

4. Run build to ensure nothing breaks:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
  </action>
  <verify>
- `ls style/revolution/ 2>&1` shows "No such file or directory"
- `npm run build` succeeds
- `du -sh dist/` shows reduced size (no Revolution Slider in build)
  </verify>
  <done>Revolution Slider directory deleted, build still succeeds</done>

  <what-built>
Replaced Revolution Slider (~420KB) with Embla Carousel (~8KB) for hero slider.
Replaced LightGallery (~25KB) with GLightbox (~11KB) for portfolio lightbox.
Total estimated savings: ~426KB JavaScript.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000

2. **Hero Slider Verification:**
   - [ ] Slider displays fullscreen with professional quality
   - [ ] First image (cassiecay-slider7.jpg) loads correctly
   - [ ] After ~6 seconds, fades to second image (cassiecay-slider2.jpg)
   - [ ] Fade transition is smooth (not jarring)
   - [ ] Text overlay visible: "capturing beautiful moments" and "Cassie Cay Photography"
   - [ ] Text is positioned top-right with correct styling (italic script font)
   - [ ] Hover your mouse over the slider - it should NOT pause (BUG-03 fix)
   - [ ] Let it loop through several cycles to confirm continuous operation

3. **Lightbox Verification:**
   - [ ] Scroll to Portfolio section
   - [ ] Click any portfolio image
   - [ ] Lightbox opens with fade transition
   - [ ] Use left/right arrow keys to navigate
   - [ ] Press Escape to close
   - [ ] Click outside image to close
   - [ ] Click filter button (e.g., "Family")
   - [ ] Click filtered image - lightbox should work
   - [ ] Navigate through filtered images

4. **Mobile Verification:**
   - [ ] Resize browser to mobile width (< 480px)
   - [ ] Hero slider still displays and auto-advances
   - [ ] Text overlay is readable (smaller font)
   - [ ] Lightbox works on mobile viewport

5. **Console Check:**
   - [ ] Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - [ ] Check Console tab - no JavaScript errors
   - [ ] Check Network tab - no 404s for missing files

6. **Production Build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```
   - [ ] Open http://localhost:4173
   - [ ] Repeat slider and lightbox checks
   - [ ] Verify all functionality works in production build

  <name>Task 3: Final bundle size verification</name>
  <files>None (reporting only)</files>
  <action>
1. Measure final JS bundle size:
   ```bash
   # custom-plugins.js size (should be smaller without LightGallery)
   wc -c style/js/custom-plugins.js

   # Embla files
   wc -c style/js/embla-carousel.umd.js style/js/embla-carousel-autoplay.umd.js

   # GLightbox
   wc -c style/js/glightbox.min.js

   # Total new libraries
   echo "Embla + GLightbox total:"
   cat style/js/embla-carousel.umd.js style/js/embla-carousel-autoplay.umd.js style/js/glightbox.min.js | wc -c
   ```

2. Compare to removed Revolution Slider (was ~420KB):
   ```bash
   # Revolution Slider is deleted, but for reference it was:
   # - jquery.themepunch.tools.min.js: 111KB
   # - jquery.themepunch.revolution.min.js: 65KB
   # - Plus extensions: ~244KB
   # Total: ~420KB
   ```

3. Document savings in summary.
  </action>
  <verify>
- New libraries total < 50KB (Embla ~7KB + GLightbox ~11KB + Autoplay ~1KB)
- Revolution Slider directory deleted (was ~420KB+)
- Net savings > 350KB JavaScript
  </verify>
  <done>Bundle size reduction documented, Phase 8 complete</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Revolution Slider directory deleted
2. Human verified slider and lightbox quality
3. No console errors in browser
4. Production build works
5. Bundle size significantly reduced
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Revolution Slider completely removed (directory deleted)
- Human approved visual quality of:
  - Hero slider (fullscreen, fade, text overlay)
  - Portfolio lightbox (navigation, keyboard, filter compatibility)
- BUG-03 confirmed fixed (no pause on hover)
- Total JavaScript savings > 350KB
- Production build functional
</success_criteria>
