# Milestone v2.2: Mobile Navigation - Audit Report

**Milestone:** v2.2 Mobile Navigation
**Audited:** 2026-01-21T22:15:00Z
**Status:** PASSED ✓

## Executive Summary

All requirements satisfied. Cross-phase integration verified. E2E flows complete. No critical gaps or technical debt.

**Scores:**
- Requirements: 6/6 (100%)
- Phases: 1/1 (100%)
- Integration: 5/5 flows (100%)
- E2E Flows: 5/5 complete (100%)

## Milestone Definition

**Goal:** Modernize the mobile navigation by replacing Bootstrap 5's navbar collapse component with an offcanvas drawer that slides in from the left. This provides a more native mobile UX while maintaining full compatibility with the existing sticky header implementation.

**Scope:**
- Phase 20: Offcanvas Navigation

**Requirements Coverage:**

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| NAV-01: Replace navbar collapse with offcanvas component (slide from left) | 20 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| NAV-02: Hamburger icon opens offcanvas menu on mobile | 20 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| NAV-03: Close button and backdrop dismiss menu | 20 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| NAV-04: Navigation links close menu after click | 20 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| NAV-05: Menu works correctly with existing sticky header | 20 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| NAV-06: Smooth animation transitions | 20 | ✓ SATISFIED |

**Coverage:** 6/6 requirements satisfied (100%)

## Phase Summary

### Phase 20: Offcanvas Navigation

**Status:** PASSED ✓
**Plans:** 1/1 complete
**Score:** 6/6 must-haves verified

**What Was Built:**
- Bootstrap 5 offcanvas drawer for mobile navigation
- Hamburger icon synced with offcanvas state via event listeners
- Shared offcanvas instance for both sticky and fixed navbars
- Accessible navigation with complete ARIA attributes
- Desktop horizontal navbar unchanged

**Key Decisions:**
- Shared offcanvas instance (not cloned) for state management simplicity
- Offcanvas slides from left (offcanvas-start) for better mobile thumb reach
- 280px drawer width for optimal touch targets
- Navigation links close drawer on click for one-page site UX

**Commits:**
- `079d357` - feat(20-01): add offcanvas mobile navigation structure
- `b84e2ea` - feat(20-01): implement offcanvas event handlers
- `01cfd32` - style(20-01): add offcanvas drawer styling
- `a827499` - docs(20-01): complete offcanvas navigation plan

## Integration Verification

### Cross-Phase Integration (3/3 verified)

| From Phase | To Phase | Status | Evidence |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|
| Phase 10 (Bootstrap 5) | Phase 20 | ✓ CONNECTED | Bootstrap 5.3.3 offcanvas API used |
| Phase 12 (Sticky Header) | Phase 20 | ✓ CONNECTED | Clone targets shared offcanvas |
| Phase 20 | User Interface | ✓ CONNECTED | Mobile navigation fully functional |

### E2E Flow Verification (5/5 complete)

#### Flow 1: User Opens Mobile Menu ✓ COMPLETE
- User taps hamburger icon on mobile viewport (<992px)
- Offcanvas drawer slides in from left
- Hamburger icon animates to "X" shape
- Navigation links displayed with dark background

**Wiring:** Hamburger button → `data-bs-toggle="offcanvas"` → `#offcanvasNav`

#### Flow 2: User Closes Mobile Menu ✓ COMPLETE
- User can close via 4 methods: close button (X), backdrop click, ESC key, nav link click
- All methods smoothly close the drawer
- Hamburger icon reverts to hamburger shape
- Desktop navigation unaffected

**Wiring:** Close button → `data-bs-dismiss="offcanvas"` / Nav links → `offcanvasInstance.hide()`

#### Flow 3: Sticky Header Shares Offcanvas ✓ COMPLETE
- User scrolls down, sticky header appears
- Sticky header hamburger opens same offcanvas drawer
- No duplicate elements or state issues
- Z-index layering correct (drawer above sticky header)

**Wiring:** Sticky clone → same `#offcanvasNav` element

#### Flow 4: Navigation Links Work ✓ COMPLETE
- All 6 navigation links present in offcanvas
- Links scroll to target section
- Links auto-close drawer after click
- Smooth scroll behavior preserved

**Wiring:** Nav links → scroll class → offcanvas hide handler

#### Flow 5: Desktop Navigation Unaffected ✓ COMPLETE
- Desktop viewport (≥992px) shows horizontal navbar
- Hamburger icon hidden on desktop
- No offcanvas behavior on desktop
- Responsive breakpoint at 992px

**Wiring:** Bootstrap responsive classes → `.d-lg-none` / `.d-none d-lg-block`

### Orphaned Exports

**None detected.** All phase exports consumed:
- Offcanvas drawer element used by hamburger buttons
- Event handlers connected to offcanvas lifecycle
- Sticky header clone properly updated

### Missing Connections

**None detected.** All planned integrations complete:
- Hamburger buttons wired to offcanvas
- Bootstrap API integrated in custom-scripts.js
- Sticky header updated for shared instance
- All ARIA attributes present

## Critical Gaps

**None.** All requirements satisfied, all flows complete, all integrations verified.

## Technical Debt

**None.** No TODO/FIXME comments, no stub implementations, no deferred items logged.

## Anti-Patterns Found

**None detected.** Code quality checks passed:
- ✓ No placeholder text
- ✓ No empty implementations
- ✓ No console.log-only code
- ✓ No stub patterns
