# Requirements: v2.1 SEO

**Defined:** 2026-01-21
**Core Value:** The site must remain fast, secure, and easy for Cassie to update.

## Overview

Improve search engine discoverability through technical SEO and image optimization. Based on research, the site has modern image formats and basic Open Graph tags but is missing: descriptive alt text on 84 images, JSON-LD structured data, image sitemap, and Twitter Cards.

---

## Structured Data (JSON-LD) ✓

- [x] **SEO-01**: Add LocalBusiness JSON-LD schema with business info, geographic coordinates, and service area — Phase 16 ✓
- [x] **SEO-02**: Add Photographer schema nested within LocalBusiness — Phase 16 ✓
- [x] **SEO-03**: Add ImageGallery schema for portfolio rich results — Phase 16 ✓
- [x] **SEO-04**: Validate JSON-LD with Google Rich Results Test before deploy — Phase 16 ✓

## Social Meta Tags ✓

- [x] **SEO-05**: Add og:image meta tag with 1200x630 preview image — Phase 17 ✓
- [x] **SEO-06**: Add Twitter Card meta tags (twitter:card, twitter:title, twitter:description, twitter:image) — Phase 17 ✓

## Image Sitemap ✓

- [x] **SEO-07**: Create build-time script to generate image-sitemap.xml — Phase 18 ✓
- [x] **SEO-08**: Include image captions and geo_location in sitemap — Phase 18 ✓
- [x] **SEO-09**: Update main sitemap.xml to reference image sitemap (sitemap index) — Phase 18 ✓
- [x] **SEO-10**: Add sitemap generation to postbuild hook — Phase 18 ✓

## Alt Text Generation ✓

- [x] **SEO-11**: Create alt text generation script using Claude Vision API — Phase 19 ✓
- [x] **SEO-12**: Generate descriptive alt text for all 76 portfolio images — Phase 19 ✓
- [x] **SEO-13**: Include location and service keywords in alt text — Phase 19 ✓
- [x] **SEO-14**: Update HTML with generated alt text — Phase 19 ✓

---

## Success Criteria

1. ✓ Google Rich Results Test validates all JSON-LD schemas without errors
2. ✓ Twitter Card Validator shows complete preview with image (human verification needed)
3. ✓ Image sitemap includes 100 portfolio images with captions
4. ✓ All 76 portfolio images have descriptive alt text (8 non-portfolio excluded)
5. ✓ No new runtime dependencies added (build-time only)

## Dependencies

| Requirement | Dependency |
|-------------|------------|
| SEO-07 to SEO-10 | `sitemap` npm package (v9.0.0) |
| SEO-11 to SEO-14 | `openai` npm package (v6.16.0) for ccproxy compatibility |

## Out of Scope (Deferred to v2.2+)

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Image filename renaming | Labor-intensive for 84 images; alt text has bigger impact |
| Blog platform | Only valuable with monthly high-quality content commitment |
| FAQ schema | After core SEO foundation is solid |
| Google Business Profile setup | Parallel activity, not code-related |
