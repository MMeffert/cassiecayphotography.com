2. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) in the top right to edit
3. Use **Ctrl+F** (or **Cmd+F** on Mac) to search for the text you want to change

## Common Things You Might Edit

| What | Search for this text |
|------|---------------------|
| About Me section | `I'm Cassie` or your bio text |
| Contact info | Your email or phone number |
| Service descriptions | The service name like `Family` or `Newborn` |
| Pricing/session info | Search for dollar amounts or session details |

## Tips
- Don't change anything that looks like code (things with `<` and `>` brackets, `class=`, `src=`, etc.)
- If something breaks, don't panic! Mitchell can fix it by reverting the change
- Test your changes by visiting cassiecayphotography.com after a few minutes

## Need to Add/Remove Photos?
For now, let Mitchell know and he can help with that part. The photos require some special processing to keep the site fast.
