# How to Update Your Website

## Getting Started
1. Go to **github.com** and sign in with your Google account (cassiecayphoto@gmail.com)
2. You should see **MMeffert/cassiecayphotography.com** in your repositories

## Making Text Changes

1. Click on **index.html** (this is your entire website)
2. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) in the top right to edit
3. Use **Ctrl+F** (or **Cmd+F** on Mac) to search for the text you want to change
4. Make your edits directly in the file
5. Scroll down and click the green **"Commit changes"** button
6. In the popup, you can leave the default message or write something like "Updated about section"
7. Click **"Commit changes"** again

Your changes will automatically go live in about 2-3 minutes!

## Common Things You Might Edit

| What | Search for this text |
|------|---------------------|
| About Me section | `I'm Cassie` or your bio text |
| Contact info | Your email or phone number |
| Service descriptions | The service name like `Family` or `Newborn` |
| Pricing/session info | Search for dollar amounts or session details |

## Tips
- Don't change anything that looks like code (things with `<` and `>` brackets, `class=`, `src=`, etc.)
- If something breaks, don't panic! Mitchell can fix it by reverting the change
- Test your changes by visiting cassiecayphotography.com after a few minutes

## Adding New Photos

1. Go to the `new-photos/` folder in GitHub
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag in your photos (use names like `cassiecay-F44.jpg`)
4. Click "Commit changes"
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for processing
6. Open `index.html` and find the new image blocks at the bottom of the portfolio section
7. Cut each block (from `MOVE THIS BLOCK START` to `MOVE THIS BLOCK END`)
8. Paste where you want it in the portfolio
9. Update the category if needed: change `family` to `milestone`, `senior`, `newborn`, or `couples`
10. Update the alt text: replace `[ADD DESCRIPTION]` with a description of the photo
11. Commit your changes
